To run the signing test script first setup the signers configured in
testsigners.properties by running the following in $SIGNSERVER_HOME

$ ./bin/signserver setproperties res/signingtest/testsigners.properties
$ ./bin/signserver reload 10000
$ ./bin/signserver reload 10001

Now it is possible to run the test script from the directory
$SIGNSERVER_HOME/res/signingtest

$ ./signingtest.sh

This will process the sample files and produce a series of result files whos names starts
with "test-out".
