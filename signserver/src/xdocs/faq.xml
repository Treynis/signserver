        Can SignServer be deployed on other application servers than JBoss
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
         Not by default, but it shouldn't be much work do adopt the deployment scripts to fit
         other application servers needs. Contact the development team for more information.

      <question>
        The web pages if SignServer only works locally, not from other remote machines.
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
        This is because by default JBoss only listens on localhost. If you haven't configured http/s during deployment (j2ee.web-nohttps=true) you can edit the server.xml in JBOSS_HOME/server/default/deploy/jboss-web.deployer and change the address of the connector from 127.0.0.1 to 0.0.0.0.
        </p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <code>
&lt;Connector port="8080" address="0.0.0.0"
        </code>
