This is a very simple header/content/footer layout for the public www site for signserver
this directory is a "source" dir, make your changes here and then run ./build.sh to generate public pages.
It works like this: 

header.html + content-file.html + footer.html is concateneted to the OUTDIR(see build.sh)/content-file.html 

eg:

cat header.html > ../htdocs/tokens.html
cat tokens.html >> ../htdocs/tokens.html
cat footer.html >> ../htdocs/tokens.html

thus you change header and footer once to affect all pages.

if you need to add a new file add it to PAGES in build.sh

if you need more directories for layout and such add them to LAYOUT in build.sh

And if anybody(althoug unlikely) wants to use build.sh it's GPL so go ahead.
