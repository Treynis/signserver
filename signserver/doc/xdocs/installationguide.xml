Installation guide describing step-by-step how to setup a SignServer cluster on CentOS 4.4. Even if the document
is specific for this OS is should be quite easy to adopt it to other environments as well. It 
can be downloaded here either as <a href="docs/SignServer_3_0_Installation_Guide.pdf">PDF</a> or viewed as 
<a href="docs/SignServer_3_0_Installation_Guide.html">HTML</a>

<section name="Quick start demo guide">
<p>
This is a quick start guide to quickly get you setup with a demo Time Stamp service (TSA according to RFC3161).
It will let you quickly get a feeling how the structure of the SignServer works, so you can move on to more advanced features described in the manual.
</p>
<p>
This quick start guide assumes you are using JBoss and are running everything on localhost.
<ol>
<li>Make sure you are using Sun JDK 1.6.0_04 or later. 04 is needed for using JAX-WS 2.1 that is used for WebServices. 
<br/>It is possible to use 03 or earlier by disabling WebServices. This is described below. 
</li>
<li>Unzip JBoss to a new directory and set the APPSRV_HOME environment variable to point to this location. Ex:
<br/># export APPSRV_HOME=/home/user/jboss-4.2.2
</li>
<li>Copy build configuration sample file:
<br/># cp signserver_build.properties.sample signserver_build.properties
</li>
<li>Configure the signserver web properties:
<br/># vi signserver_build.properties
<br/>- set: j2ee.web-nohttps=true
<br/>You can use Sun Java 1.6.0_03 or earlier if you set the property:
<br/>signserverws.enabled=false
</li>
<li>Build and deploy SignServer to JBoss:
<br/># ant clean; ant deploy</li>
<li>Start JBoss:
<br/># cd $APPSRV_HOME/bin
<br/># ./run.sh
<br/>- verify that startup was ok. Tables have now been created in your database.
</li>
<li>Copy the sample timestamp service configuration:
<br/># cp sample-configs/qs_timestamp_configuration.properties qs_timestamp_configuration.properties</li>
<li>Edit the configuration to point to a sample signer keystore:
<br/># vi qs_timestamp_configuration.properties
<br/>- set WORKERGENID1.KEYSTOREPATH to point to signserver/src/test/timestamp1.p12
</li>
<li>Configure the signserver, staging, with the timestamp configuration:
<br/># bin/signserver.sh setproperties qs_timestamp_configuration.properties</li>
<li>Verify the configuration with:
<br/># bin/signserver.sh getconfig 1
</li>
<li>Finally activate the configuration with:
<br/># bin/signserver.sh reload 1
</li>
<li>Run the test-client to see that everything is up.
<br/># cd dist-client
<br/># java -jar timeStampClient.jar http://localhost:8080/signserver/tsa?signerId=1
<br/>The message "TimeStampRequest Validated" should appear once a second. Also check JBOSS_HOME/server/default/log/server.log that successful messages appear.
</li>
</ol>
If you run into problems at any stage after JBoss has been started, check the JBoss server log in $JBOSS_HOME/server/default/log/server.log for
error messages. Usually errors like database connection problems, or wrong path to the timestamp keystore will be clearly visible.
