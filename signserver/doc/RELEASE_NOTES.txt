SignServer 3.3.0
----------------
This is a major release - in total 57 features, options, bugs and stabilizations have been fixed or added. The most noteworthy changes can be seen below.

Major changes:
 - New client web services API 
 - MS Authenticode time-stamp signer
 - Support for archiving of time-stamp requests
 - Logging of all changes to service components
 - Stress test tool for measuring performance
 - Dropped support for JBoss 4.2.x.
 - Dropped support for cluster class loader
 - Dropped support for WSRA
 - Upgrade of internal cryptographic library
 - Many more minor improvements

Bug fixes:
 - Fixed the Renewal worker which required a trust store password even when a 
   trust store was not used
 - Fixed an NPE when trying to activate a worker of type Dispatcher
 - Fixed archiving that could not be done twice for the same document
 - Fixed printing of server version from CLI
 - Fixed system tests that could not be compiled after opening the project with 
   NetBeans IDE 7.2
 - Fixed StatusPropertiesWorker so that it no longer requires a cryptotoken to 
   be configured
 - Fixed Address Authorizers to return HTTP 403 (forbidden) and not HTTP 401 
   (unauthorized) as before

Notice:
 - A database change were introduced. See UPGRADE.txt for details.
 - A dependency where upgraded. See UPGRADE.txt for details.
 - Apache Ant 1.8.0 or later is now required to build SignServer.
 - The property "custom.commandfactory" is no longer supported. See the manual 
   for how to add custom Admin or Client CLI commands.
 - The Admin CLI no longer supports the "-host" argument and ignores it if 
   present.
 - The default archiver called OldDatabaseArchiver has changed the format of
   the data part of the XML serialized ArchiveData from an byte array to a 
   base64 encoded String. The change is transparent for Java clients using
   SignServer-Common.jar for parsing the ArchiveData but other clients might 
   need to be updated.
 - As an alternative to the OldDatabaseArchiver a new archiver called 
   Base64DatabaseArchiver can also be used.
