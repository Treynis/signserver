UPGRADE
=======

This document describes procedures needed to upgrade from one version of 
SignServer to a new version.
Upgrades within a major version, from 3.2.1 to 3.2.2 for example, are usually 
plug-in upgrades and can be made simply by deploying the new software. See 
RELEASE_NOTES.txt for more information about such upgrades.

1. Unpack the new sources
2. Make sure to copy over the configuration from the old installation or 
   use the provided signserver_build.properties.sample. Take special care 
   in reading the "notice" section of the RELEASE_NOTES.txt to see if any 
   configuration properties changed.
3. Copy over the p12 folder with keystores (if used).
4. Build and deploy as described in the installation guide.


From SignServer 3.2.x to SignServer 3.3.x
-----------------------------------------
Instructions will be added here when SignServer 3.3.0 has been released if 
upgrading to it would require database changes or other manual steps.
