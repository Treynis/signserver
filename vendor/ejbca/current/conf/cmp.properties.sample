# This is a sample file to override properties used
# during deployment of EJBCA
# 
# You should copy and rename this file to cmp.properties
# and customize at will.
#
# Developers: If you add fields in this file, make arrangements in CmpServlet, CmpTcpService, cmptcp-service.xml and cmptcp.xml

#------------------- CMP (RFC4210) settings -------------
# 
# Enforce a particual CA instead of taking it from the request.
# This should be the DN of the CA, i.e.:
# CN=AdminCA1,O=EJBCA Sample,C=SE 
#
# Default: empty
#cmp.defaultca=

# Defines which component from the DN should be used to look up username in EJBCA. 
# Can be CN, UID or nothing. 
# Nothing means that the DN will be used to look up the user (EJBCA will search for a user with the specified DN). 
#
# Default: empty
#cmp.extractusernamecomponent=

# If the CMP service should work in 'normal' or 'ra' mode (see docs). 
# Normal mode means that the user must be pre-registered in EJBCA (as normal), and the EJBCA user is looked up from data in the request
# (the DN or a part of the DN).
# RA mode means that the CMP client will act as an RA to EJBCA and users will be created in EJBCA when a request comes in. 
# The username that is created will be generated according to the parameters set here, it can be random or also a part of the DN, 
# optionally with pre- and postfix appended.
#
# Default normal (empty value means the same)
#cmp.operationmode=normal

# Allow the client/RA to specify that the CA should not verify POP, 
# set to true to allow no POP (raVerify in the rfc). 
# Note: only set to true if cmp.operationmode=ra.
#
# Default: false
#cmp.allowraverifypopo=false

# Which sort of protection the response messages will have, the certificate response messages can be signed by the CA
# or they can use password based mac (PBE) using the ra authenticationsecret and the same keyId and PBE algorithm that was sent in the 
# request. PBE is currently only used in RA mode.
# Possible values: signature, pbe
# Default: signature
#cmp.responseprotection=signature

# Shared secret between the CA and the RA used to authenticate valid RA messages.
#
# Default: empty
#cmp.ra.authenticationsecret=

# Which generation scheme should be used, RANDOM or DN for base username.
# Random will generate a 12 character long random username.
# DN will take a part of the request DN, which part is defined by cmp.ra.namegenerationparameters, and use as the username.
# If the same username is constructed (for exmaple UID) as an already existing user, the existing user will be modified with
# new values for profile etc, and a new certificate will be issued for that user.
#
# Default: DN
#cmp.ra.namegenerationscheme=DN

# Parameters for name generation, for DN it can be for example CN, UID or SN. 
# Either the CN or the UID from the request can be used. 
# You can add several in order to have fall-back in case the first does not exist in the DN, for example UID;SN;CN. First try UID, if it does not exist try SN (SerialNumber) etc. 
#
# Default: CN
#cmp.ra.namegenerationparameters=CN

# Prefix to generated name, a string that can contain the markup ${RANDOM} to insert 10 random chars.
# Example: 'MyPrefix - ${RANDOM}-' using RANDOM password generation will create a username like 'MyPrefix - DGR89NN54QW-GDHR473NH87Q
#
# Default: empty
#cmp.ra.namegenerationprefix=

# Postfix to generated name, a string that can contain the markup ${RANDOM} to insert 10 random chars.
# Example: MyPostfix - ${RANDOM}
#
# Default: empty
#cmp.ra.namegenerationpostfix=

# Working in RA mode an internal random password is temporarily used during certificate generation. 
# By setting this parameter you can use a fixed password instead of a random.
# Example: foo123
#
# Default: random
#cmp.ra.passwordgenparams

# The endEntityProfile to be used when adding users in RA mode. 
# Possible values are:
# The name of a End Entity Profile
# KeyId - use a End Entity Profile with the same name as the KeyId sent in the CMP request (UTF-8 encoding is used)
#
# Default: EMPTY
#cmp.ra.endentityprofile=EMPTY

# The certificateProfile to be used when adding users in RA mode. 
# Possible values are:
# The name of a Certificate Profile
# KeyId - use a Certificate Profile with the same name as the KeyId sent in the CMP request (UTF-8 encoding is used)
#
# Default: ENDUSER
#cmp.ra.certificateprofile=ENDUSER

# The CA to be used when adding users in RA mode. 
# Possible values are:
# The name of a CA
# ProfileDefault - use the default CA of the end entity profile used
# KeyId - use a CA with the same name as the KeyId sent in the CMP request (UTF-8 encoding is used)
#
# Default: AdminCA1
#cmp.ra.caname=AdminCA1

# ---------- Settings for the CMP TCP listener ----------
#
# The TCP listener is not enabled by default, because it is an MBean, which 
# requires special things. If possible you should stick to the HTTP transport
# protocol for CMP, it is much better.

# Enabled or disabled
#
# Default: false
#cmp.tcp.enabled=false

# The port number to listen to for TCP connections, if TCP transport is enabled.
# Please not that the default port number, below 1024, requires JBoss to be run with root privileges.
# It may be more convenient to use a high port number (like 5587) and forward port 829 from the os/firewall level instead.
#
# Default: 829
#cmp.tcp.portno=829

# The directory where TCP log files are stores, if TCP transport is enabled
#
# Default: ./log
#cmp.tcp.logdir=./log

# An optional TCP configuration file, if TCP transport is enabled. 
# This is a configuration file for QuickServer.
#
# Default: 
#cmp.tcp.conffile=

# The TCP bind adress, if TCP transport is enabled. 
#
# Default: 0.0.0.0
#cmp.tcp.bindadress=0.0.0.0
