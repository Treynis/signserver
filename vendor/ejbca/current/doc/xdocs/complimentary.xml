To build a succesfull PKI you can benefit from a lot of tools available. Here are listed some tools and packages that 
can be used together with PKI to even further improve your PKI experience.
</p>

<subsection name="Signserver">
    <p>
    <a href="http://www.signserver.org/">Signserver</a>
    </p>
    <p>
    The SignServer is an application for automatic signatures called by other systems not able to connect 
    to crytographic hardware. 
    It is a framework that can be customized to specific needs using simple plug-in modules. 
    The SignServer have a ready to use TimeStamp Authority (RFC 3161 compliant) and a MRTD Signer. 
    Another usage is to provide a simplified method to provide signatures in different application 
    managed from one location in the company.
    <br/>
    The SignServer have been designed for high-availability and can be clustered for maximum reliability.
    </p>

<subsection name="Hard Token Management Framework">
    <p>
    <a href="http://www.hardtokenmgmt.org/">Hard Token Management Framework</a>
    </p>
	<p>
	The hard token management framework is a framework for creating applications to manage to complete life cycle of
	issuing hard tokens (smart cards, USB PKI dongles, etc) to end users.
	<br/>
	The framework is an API that you build a GUI on top of.

<subsection name="CSRTool">
    <p>
    <a href="http://www.strongauth.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=32&amp;Itemid=32">CSRTool website</a>
    <br/>
    or<br/>
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/csrtool">CSRTool at sourceforge</a>
    </p>
    <p>
    A graphical tool for generating RSA and ECDSA cryptographic key-pairs, creating Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) from them, 
    and combining the key-pair with an issued digital certificate to create a secure portable container (PKCS12, JKS, JCEKS, etc.)    
    </p><p>
    Some features:
    <ul>
    <li>Generates RSA public and private key-pairs in sizes ranging from 1024 to 8192 bits.</li>
    <li>Generates Elliptic Curve DSA public and private key-pairs using either the ANSI X9.62 named curves, or custom parameters for your own curve if so inclined.</li>
    <li>Saves the private-key in a PKCS8 file with Password-Based-Encryption using the SHA1withTripleDES algorithm.</li>
    <li>Generates a PEM-encoded CSR that can be submitted to a CA either through a web-form or e-mail.</li>
    <li>Generates keyUsage and/or the subjectAltName extensions (optionally) in the RSA-based CSR.</li>
    <li>Combines the private-key from the previously-stored PKCS8 file and the newly returned digital certificate, into a PKCS12 file that can be used for importation into desired applications.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
</subsection>

<subsection name="Bouncycastle">
    <p>
    <a href="http://www.bouncycastle.org/">Bouncycastle website</a>
    </p>
    <p>
    Using Bouncycastle you can create your own tools and applications, or PKI enable your existing java applications.
    </p>
    <p>
    Bouncycastle also have a section with complimentary packages (under resources) that you should look at.
    </p>

<section name="Complimentary proprietary software">
    <p>
    EJBCA can also be used with numerous products from the non-free world. To be listed here, the software
    should work flawlessly with EJBCA and the vendor should:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>provide free and open documentation on how to use the product with EJBCA</li>
    <li>continuously update the documentation</li>
    <li>promote EJBCA</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    </p>
    
<subsection name="GemSAFE Toolbox">
    <p>
    GemSAFE toolbox and tokens are developed by Gemalto. Using this product an
    organization can setup a secure platform for online banking, transaction,
    identity verification and data exchange. It has been adapted by lots of
    well known companies and organizations for instant, Cisco, Airbus, BMW,
    China Construction Bank, Industrial Commercial bank of China (ICBC) and etc.
    </p>
    <p>
    Some of the GemSAFE features:
    <ul>
    <li>Email signature and encryption</li>
    <li>Smartcard logon</li>
    <li>Strong authentication with SSL</li>
    <li>Document signature and encryption</li>
    <li>VB macro signature</li>
    <li>Support 16 languages</li>
    <li>Works with MS Outlook, Thunderbird, Lotus Notes, IE, Netscape, FireFox and more</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
	GemSAFE was successfully used together with EJBCA for the ZhuHai Local
	Taxation Bureau project, listed in the <a href="installations.html">reference installations</a> section.
    </p>
    <p>
    There is a howto for using GemSAFE with EJBCA in the <a href="howto.html">Howto</a> section.
