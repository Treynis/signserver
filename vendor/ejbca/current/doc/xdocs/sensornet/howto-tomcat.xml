<section name="Obtaining a certificate for Apache Jakarta Tomcat">
	<p>
	The process is quite simple. Send an e-mail to the SensorNetCA requesting a Tomcat certificate.
	The e-mail should contain: 
	<ul>
<li>The ip name of your server </li>
<li>Your name and e-mail address </li>
<li>Your phone number </li>
<li>Your Organization </li>
<li>Your Organizational Unit</li> 
<li>Your City </li>
<li>Your State </li>
<li>Your Country</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p> 
The key store for your server will be generated by the CA, and is ready to use when you receive it.
When your request is approved, I will mail you the tomcat.jks file containing your certificate.
For security reasons, it would be best if you first obtain a personal SensorNet certificate so that
I can send you encrypted e-mail.
</p>
	<p>
Install the tomcat.jks file at the location pointed to in your tomcat ssl configuration file.
