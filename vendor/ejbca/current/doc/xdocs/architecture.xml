    	The following diagram is a very rough schema of the current architecture of EJBCA.

  <section name="Sample setup architecture">
    <p>
    	The following diagram shows a good example setup of a secured CA with external OCSP responders
    	and an external RA server that receives certificate requests. The request are periodically 
    	pulled by the CA and responses returned to the external RA. 
    	No network traffic flows from the right the left across FW2.

  <section name="External RA">
    <p>
In some cases, for security reasons, is it preferable to deny all inbound traffic to the CA and instead let the CA periodically 
fetch and process information from external trusted data sources. 
For an overview of the solution see the illustration.
<br/>
The ExtRA API contains the most basic functions like:

<ul>
<li>Generate Certificate from PKCS10</li>
<li>Generate PKCS12 for the end user</li>
<li>KeyRecovery of the users key (if requested using PKCS12)</li>
<li>Edit users</li>
<li>Revoke Certificates</li>
</ul>

The external API, named extra, is downloaded separately, or checked out separately from the SVN using the module name 'extra'.
</p><p>
Documentation about the ExtRA API is in the doc subdirectory of the extra subproject.
