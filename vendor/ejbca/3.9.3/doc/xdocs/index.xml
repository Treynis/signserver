<section name="About EJBCA">
<p>
EJBCA is an enterprise class PKI Certificate Authority built on J2EE technology. 
It is a robust, high performance, platform independent, flexible, and component based CA to be used 
stand-alone or integrated in other J2EE applications.
</p>
<p>
EJBCA is an enterprise class PKI, meaning that you can use EJBCA to build a complete PKI infrastructure for your organization.
If you only want to issue a few single certificates for testing, there are probably options that will get you started quicker, 
but if you want a serious PKI we recommend EJBCA.
