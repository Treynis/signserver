NOT to use Outlook Express</h2>
Note that I imported my own certificate into the Outlook Express
Address Book. The ONLY way to do this (that I have found) is to do it
from an LDAP server as shown above. This is very non-standard. You can
import a certificate file into Outlook Express by using the usual
Internet Explorer import process (Tools, Options, Security, Digital
IDs) but these certificates will not appear when you try to set the
signing certificate for this account. So, after you import your own
certificate into the Address Book, go into your mail server properties
and select the signing certificate that will be used when you send
mail. (Figure 12a) <br>
      <br>
We highly recommend the Mozilla browser, or its separate components
Firefox (browser) and Thunderbird (mail client). It will make your life
easier.<br>

have their email address and digital certificate automatically added to
your Address Book. You can verify this by opening your Address Book,

If you try to send the above message, you will find that an error
message appears (figure 17) telling you that the message is being sent
with only 40-bit encryption. Microsoft claims this is a feature (<a
 href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;262003">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;262003</a>)!<br>
      <br>
"This issue is by design following the Secure/Multipurpose Internet
Mail
Extensions 2 (S/MIME2) specification. There are many e-mail clients
that do not support Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions 3
(S/MIME3), so the S/MIME2 default (RC2 40-bit) is used for encryption
when Outlook Express does not know the capabilities of the recipient."
This is of course ancient poppycock, and another example of why
Microsoft cannot be relied upon to properly handle PKI. Do yourself a
favor and switch to Mozilla. Mozilla also does not force you to
manually import the certificate into the address book. It does it
automagically. </td>
