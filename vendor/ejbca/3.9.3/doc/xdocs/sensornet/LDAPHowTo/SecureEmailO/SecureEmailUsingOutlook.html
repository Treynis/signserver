certificates in our online directory (LDAP). You can easily retrieve
their certificates via the directory and place them into your computer.

both the "<b>Encrypt message contents and attachments</b>" and "<b>Add
digital signature to outgoing message</b>" boxes are checked (see
Figure 17). You must have already retrieved the recipient's digital
certificate onto your computer (please read the above section entitled

so), and you will also be prompted to enter the passphrase for your
digital certificate (see Figure 19). After you have done so, the email
