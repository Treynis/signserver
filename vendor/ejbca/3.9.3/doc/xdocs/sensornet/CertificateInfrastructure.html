component of Homeland Security, it is necessary to implement a viable

the encryption tools and information necessary to provide protection
from most of these threats. SensorNet has decided to implement a
Public/Private Key Certificate infrastructure. Initially this will be
done via software, but soon will be converted to hardware-based tokens.
This Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) has several advantages:<br>

server owner.</li>
        <li>Client certificate: Attests to the identity of the Web user

        <li>Certificate authority certificate: Attests to the identity
of the certificate authority (CA) that signed the server and client
certificates.</li>
      </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">In principal, there is a root CA
certificate that is self signed and that everyone trusts. If the root
CA certificate is compromised, the whole certificate structure falls
apart. It is perhaps a philosophical issue, but the original goal of a
certificate authority hierarchy, which would allow each certificate to
be traced up to the root CA, was never established because the notion
of an identity does not scale well. In a small community, everyone
knows everyone else so the binding of a name to an identity is not
difficult. However, if your friend John Smith moved to New York City,
it will be very difficult to know which John Smith in the telephone
book is your friend. Fortunately, the SensorNet community is smaller
and most users will have government-issued credentials to vouch for
their identities, so we can be confident of identities. For SensorNet,
less formal measures are called for. SensorNet is its own root CA and
has self signed the SensorNetCA certificate (in the name of SensorNet).
Due care is taken to keep the CA computer backed up and locked up in a
secure location. This is the correct thing to do because for our
purposes, we trust ourselves more than we trust an external CA such as
VeriSign.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">The format for identity
certificates is spelled out in the PKI (public key infrastructure)
specifications called X.509. Currently, the certificates we issue
correspond to the latest, version 3 specification. These certificates
bind an identity in the real world to a public key. For our purposes,
our unique identity is specified by what is called a distinguished name
(DN) which is composed of a person's real name, country, organization,
organizational unit, city, state, and e-mail address. However, since
certificates can also be issued to computers and other non-human
entities, the notion of an identity is actually broader and fuzzier
than might be ideal. An X.509v3 certificate allows a certificate holder
to create a digital signature, to use the keys for encryption, to
create S/MIME e-mail, and to sign trusted objects (e.g., Active-X
controls). These privileges are actually delegated separately by
different bits in the certificate's extensions. The contents of my
SensorNet certificate show that I can use my certificate as an SSL
client, for secure E-mail, and for object signing.<br>

Identity certificates allow user-friendly, secure access to a Web site
with strong authentication. Modern Web servers (Netscape, IIS, Apache)
can all be set up to require client certificates for site access. Out
of the box, it is trivial to configure the server to accept only
SensorNet certificates, so that anyone with a valid SensorNet
certificate will be authenticated securely and can use SSL for secure
access. No user ids and passwords are required. However, once per
browser session, the user will have to unlock his private certificate
key with a local password. The SensorNet CA web site is set up this way
on a Tomcat server. To access this server, go to [link removed].<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Access to a site can also be
controlled by using "basic" authentication &#8212; user ids and passwords.
There are several problems with this<br>
approach. The biggest problem is that this solution does not scale
well. If a new user is added and we used basic authentication, we would
have to enroll the user separately at each server. Then there is the
problem of allowing the user to securely set his password on each of
these machines, especially if you do not want to give the user a login
account on the machine (an invitation to a security breach). With
SensorNet issued certificates, new users are automatically granted
access to all SensorNet sites requiring certificates for access.&nbsp; <br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Passwords also present several
security problems. If the host computer gets hacked, the (hashed)
password file may become compromised (thus allowing offline brute force
attacks) requiring that all users get new passwords. This has proved to
be a logistical problem. Passwords can be easily sniffed if the user's
computer gets hacked, and
good passwords are hard to remember and thus get written down on
sticky notes attached to the computer for all to see. There is also
generally no restriction to the number of times that a password-based
Web access pop up can fail (or else there could be easy denial of
service attacks). Therefore, access via user id and password is subject
to password guessing attacks. </td>

Client certificates allow users to sign things, solving the
authenticity security requirement. It is very easy to spoof E-mail, so
it is good practice to sign all electronic communications. The PGP
community has been routinely signing all their mail for years, but I
feel that the X.509 solution scales better and more user friendly than
PGP.<br>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">PGP uses identity certificates
also. However, PGP certificates are not signed by a CA. They are signed
by your friends and acquaintances, or other people who vouch for your
identity. This is called the "web of trust" model. X.509 certificates
are signed by a CA that presumably you trust. There is much less
baggage associated with X.509 because you do not have to go to key
signing parties to get your PKI key well validated -- That is the
function of the CA.<br>

Your public key is your cyber identity. It can be used in other
contexts to grant you authority to do things. The concept of authority
certificates is the basis for the SPKI (simple public key
infrastructure) that is currently in an IETF draft. See <a
 href="http://theworld.com/%7Ecme/html/spki.html">http://theworld.com/~cme/html/spki.html</a>.<br>
Provided that you can access your private key to unlock your
certificate (to prevent spoofing), extremely complicated security
policies can be implemented using a collection of authorization
certificates.<br>

S/MIME is a specification for secure electronic messaging. In 1995,
several software vendors got together and created S/MIME to solve a
very real problem -- interception and forgery of e-mail. Protecting
sensitive data is a real concern, especially in a world that is becoming<br>
increasingly more wired. The goal of S/MIME is to make it easy to
secure messages from prying eyes. Since its creation, S/MIME has come a
long way. Most mail clients support S/MIME encrypted and signed e-mail.
All of the major industry players have also agreed to support the
S/MIME standard.&nbsp; Again, sending secure e-mail is like practicing
safe sex &#8212; you need to do it. Yes, not everything you send needs to be
encrypted. However, it is very easy to intercept e-mail and to modify
it. A malicious entity can put damaging words into your innocent
e-mail. In today's world, security by obscurity does not work any more.<br>

To combat the threat of computer viruses, executable code is now being
signed to prove its authenticity and integrity. Java applets and
Active-X controls are examples of the types of things that should be
signed. If we create code that runs on a user's machine, it should be
signed for both the user's peace of mind and for our legal protection.
Various PKI tools allows you to use SensorNet Client Certificates for
code signing.<br>

with Outlook or with Outlook Express.&nbsp; If you are going to do
