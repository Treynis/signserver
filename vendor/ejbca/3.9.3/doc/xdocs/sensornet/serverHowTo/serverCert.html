      <td>The process is quite simple. Send an e-mail to the
SensorNetCA requesting a certificate. The e-mail should contain:
      <ul>
        <li>The ip name of your server or node, or the name of the
application</li>
        <li>Your name and e-mail address</li>
        <li>Your phone number</li>
        <li>Your Organization</li>
        <li>Your Organizational Unit</li>
        <li>Your City</li>
        <li>Your State</li>
        <li>Your Country</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The key store for your server will be generated by the CA, and
is ready to use when you receive it.<br>
It is easiest if you get a .p12 certificate. This will be the default
unless you ask for something else (PEM). If you do NOT want a pkcs#12
certificate, you will have to create a certificate signing request on
your host. Otherwise this is not necessary.</p>
      <p>When your request is approved, I will mail you a link to
download the certificate. The certificate will be protected using the
password in the e-mail. It is best if you change this to a different
(but good) password.</p>
      <p>It should not be necessary to do so, but if you need to
extract the private key from the PKCS12 (.p12) file, follow these
steps: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Convert the P12 to PEM format with the openssl 'pkcs12'
utility:<br>
$ openssl pkcs12 -in TestNode.p12 -out TestNode.pem</li>
        <li>This will prompt you for a password for the PEM file which
must be used when processing the PEM file with openssl utilities.</li>
        <li>The PEM file contains the private key. Copy everything
between and including the lines<br>
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----<br>
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----<br>
and store in a file with a .key extension.</li>
      </ul>
