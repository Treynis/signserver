# Extended key usage configuration file for EJBCA
#
# This file specifies available extended key usages.
# There are a number of standard extended key usages, but any one with possibility to create
# an OID can define his own extended key usage.
#
# Every extended key usage must have a unique id of a number starting from 1 up
# to 255. It is imporant that they are in number order.
#
# The standard key usages serve as examples. 
# Note! These standard fields are really used, so don't change them, add your own in the end.

# The unique OID of the extended key usage (Required)
#extendedkeyusage.1.oid = 1.2.3.4  
# Language string of the extended key usage (Required). 
#     The language string is translated if it is present in the src/adminweb/languages files for your selected language. Otherwise it is displayed as it is.
#     If you use 'null' as name, the extended key usage will not be visible. Useful to remove deprecated entries but still keep the documentation for it.
