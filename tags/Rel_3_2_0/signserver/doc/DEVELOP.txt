DEVELOP
------

After checking out the project there will be errors because some source files
(i.e. Web Services stubs) has not been generated yet. Those errors will
disappear after configuring and building SignServer.


Eclipse
-------
To build successfully using Eclipse, there are .classpath and .project files in
the package and in the source code repository.
Checkout SignServer either using the Subversion CLI or as a project in Eclipse.
Simply check out SignServer as projects and you are almost set. 
Web service stubs for test classes are generated when the tests are built. To 
get rid of all build errors in Eclipse you need to build classes and tests: 
 ant clean
 ant
 ant test:signserver:compile
Then do a Refresh in the IDE.

NetBeans IDE
------------
There are multiple NetBeans IDE projects for SignServer. The project 
modules/SignServer-Project is a NetBeans IDE FreeForm project that uses the
ANT-scripts for building and includes the sources from most modules. In addition 
each module has its own project under the folder modules/ that can be opened 
with NetBeans IDE.
