			     <h3>Building and deploying</h3>
				 <p>
To build and deploy the SignServer first make sure that ant, java and jboss is installed properly.
<p>
Then unzip the signserver package and go to it's home directory.
<p>

Before you start make, sure you have a web server key store in JKS format, (and make sure that the server certificate have the right host name in it's CN). Name it tomcat.jks at put it in a p12 subdirectory. Also place the web server root certificate in DER encoding in the same directory, call it rootcert.cer
<p>
Edit the signserver_build.properties file. At least configure the httpsserver.password property.
<p>
If you are using another database that hsql built in Jboss (recommended for production use) then configure the database properties. 
<p>
Then edit the signserver_server.properties file. This is the file where the available signers are configured and which SignToken they should use. Default is a time-stamp token with a PKCS12 sign token as signerId '1'.
<p>
Do ant deploy and then restart Jboss. 
<p>
Then edit the signserver_cli.properties and set the hostname.* properties.
<p>
Now you are ready to configure the signer and signtoken. This is done by the bin\signserver.sh setProperty <signerId> <property> <value> command. See section 'Administrating the signserver' for more information about available cli commands.
