			     <h3>Signers</h3>
				 <p>

There currently exists two types of signers. The first one is the time stamp signer generating RFC 3161 compliant timestamps using the Bouncycastle library. The other is a MRTD signer creating 'Machine Reader Travel Document' signatures using the RSA algorithm from pre-padded data.
Time-stamp Signer
The time-stamp signer have the classpath: se.primeKey.signserver.server.signers.MRTDSigner

<h4>Overview</h4>
The time stamp server generates time stamp tokens and have the support for the following options:

<ul>
<li>Set of accepted policies
<li>Set of accepted algorithms
<li>Set of accepted extensions
<li>Accuracy microseconds
<li>Accuracy milliseconds
<li>Accuracy seconds
<li>Included certificate chain (currently doesn't include CRLs)
<li>Ordering
<li>TSA name
</ul>

The time stamp signer currently don't support:
<ul>
<li>CRL inclusion
<li>Signed attributes
<li>Unsigned attributes 
</ul>

Timestamps requests are served through a http service at the URL: 
'http://<hostname>/signserver/tsa?signerId=<signer Id>'
If no 'signerId' parameter is specified then will the id of 1 be used as default.
<p>
The time-stamp signer requires a time-stamp certificate with the extended key usage 'time-stamp' only. 

<h4>Available Properties</h4>

The following properties can be configured with the signer:

<ul>
<li>TIMESOURCE = property containing the classpath to the ITimeSource implementation that should be used. (OPTIONAL, default LocalComputerTimeSource)
<li>ACCEPTEDALGORITHMS = A ';' separated string containing accepted algorithms, can be null if it shouldn't be used. (OPTIONAL, Strongly recommended)
Supported Algorithms are: GOST3411, MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, RIPEMD128, RIPEMD160, RIPEMD256
<li>ACCEPTEDPOLICIES =  A ';' separated string containing accepted policies, can be null if it shouldn't be used. (OPTIONAL, Recommended)
<li>ACCEPTEDEXTENSIONS = A ';' separated string containing accepted extensions, can be null if it shouldn't be used. (OPTIONAL)
<li>DEFAULTTSAPOLICYOID = The default policy ID of the time stamp authority (REQUIRED, if no policy OID is specified in the request then will this value be used.)
<li>ACCURACYMICROS = Accuracy in micro seconds, Only decimal number format, only one of the accuracy properties should be set (OPTIONAL)
<li>ACCURACYMILLIS = Accuracy in milliseconds, Only decimal number format, only one of the accuracy properties should be set (OPTIONAL)
<li>ACCURACYSECONDS = Accuracy in seconds. Only decimal number format, only one of the accuracy properties should be set (OPTIONAL)
<li>ORDERING = The ordering (OPTIONAL), default false.
<li>TSA = General name of the Time Stamp Authority. (OPTIONAL)
<li>MRTD Signer
The MRTD signer have the class path: se.primeKey.signserver.server.signers.MRTDSigner
</ul>

<h4>Overview</h4>

The MRTD Signer performs a RSA signing operation on incoming data. The data should already be padded. This signer i used to sign 'Machine Readable Travel Documents' i.e. electronic passports.
<p>
The signatures are requested through RMI-SSL and PrimeCard is required to build it. No load balancer is required to make it redundant, this is done with the client libs.

<h4>Available Properties</h4>
No configuration properties exists.
