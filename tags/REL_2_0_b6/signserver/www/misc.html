			     <h3>Setting Authorization Type</h3>
				 <p>
By default is client-certificate authentication required for a signature request to be processed. This can be changed with the AUTHTYPE property.

<ul>
<li>AUTHTYPE =  NOAUTH, sets the server to not require any authentication.

<li>AUTHTYPE =  CLIENTCERT (default) requires a certificate of all the clients. The certificates must be in the signers access control list and be trusted by the Java distribution, i.e imported in JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts.
</ul>

<h3>Disabling a Signer</h3>
A signer can be disabled, which means that it won't perform any signature requests or be included in the health check. 

To disable a signer set the property "DISABLED" to "TRUE"

<h3>Archiving Responses</h3>
If there is a need to save all generated responses, then set the property "ARCHIVE" to "TRUE" and all generated responses for that signer will be saved to database.

The archived responses can later be extracted from data base using the CLI interface. See the CLI section for more information.
