To develop custom signers and sign tokens the following steps have to be done
<h4>The ISigner Interface</h4>
Create a custom signer class implementing the se.primeKey.signserver.server.signers.ISigner interface. There exists a BaseSigner that can be inherited taking care of some of the functionality. If the BaseSigner is inherited only one method signData() needs to be implemented.

<p>
You can define your own properties that the signer can use for configuration.
Register the signer in the application by editing the signserver_server.properties file and assign it an id.

<p>
Make sure the custom class is available to the application server 
Redeploy the signer server and it the signer is ready to be configured and then used.

<h4>The ISignToken Interface</h4>

A custom sign token needs to implement the interface se.primeKey.signserver.server.signtokens.ISignToken. See P12SignToken for an example implementation. 

<p>
           You can define own properties for a sign token in the same way as for signers. The properties   
<p>
           are sent to the signtoken upon initialization.
Register the signtoken to a signer  by editing the signserver_server.properties file.
<p>
Make sure the custom class is available to the application server 
Redeploy the signer server.
