UPGRADE
=======

This document describes procedures needed to upgrade from one version of 
SignServer to a new version.
Upgrades within a major version, from 3.2.1 to 3.2.2 for example, are usually 
plug-in upgrades and can be made simply by deploying the new software. See 
RELEASE_NOTES.txt for more information about such upgrades.

1. Unpack the new sources
2. Make sure to copy over the configuration from the old installation or 
   use the provided signserver_build.properties.sample. Take special care 
   in reading the "notice" section of the RELEASE_NOTES.txt to see if any 
   configuration properties changed.
3. Copy over the p12 folder with keystores (if used).
4. Build and deploy as described in the installation guide.


From SignServer 3.2.x to SignServer 3.3.x
-----------------------------------------

An new column in the ArchiveData table was added. Hibernate will try to add this
column during startup of the application server. However, if the database user 
used by the data store does not have enough privileges (ie. no alter table 
rights) the table has to be altered manually:

For Oracle:
ALTER TABLE ARCHIVEDATA ADD DATAENCODING NUMBER(10,0);

For MySQL:
ALTER TABLE ArchiveData ADD dataEncoding int(11) DEFAULT NULL;

After manually changing the database schema the application server should 
be restarted.
